# LaraDock


[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-by-developers.svg)](http://zalt.me)

### What is this?

These are the Docker images used by the [LaraDock Starter](https://github.com/LaraDock/starter). If you don't know the **LaraDock Starter** than you probably don't know where you are. Check this [Documentation](https://github.com/LaraDock/starter).

Pick any image you want edit the `Dockerfile` and build your own version of the image `docker build -t {your-image-name} .`

We would love you to contribute :)
